## Got an ORION ADP-2000 terminal
The DB-25 CCITT port is connected to a DEC VT-510 with a nullmodem cable in order to test them. Guessed the Hungarian terminal's settings successfully.

| Setting    | Value                |
| ---------- | --------------------:|
| **Speed**  | 1200 baud            |
| **Data**   | 7 bits               |
| **Stop**   | 1 bit                |
| **Parity** | Even with "no check" |

## Screenshots
Later, TBD. For the impatient, internet provides: [retropages.hu/theme_46.html](http://retropages.hu/theme_46.html#Orion_ADP_2000)
