## In medias res
Purchased some dozens of retrocomputers again (as usual :P). Some of them had been being tested.
A beautiful one is the Toshiba T3100, which is to be shown together with her sister. This machine
is almost the same as the T3100E we already have, but manufactured without a factory harddisk.
Now here come the photos of the disassembled T3100 and then in comparison with the fully-functioning
T3100E:

Comparison of the two machines (they are on). Notice the nice background stuff and ignore the mess:

Cleanup, cmos battery check, reinstall, ISA bus test is on the list.
